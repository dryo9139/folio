                    <p>This process journal will be about three creative University of Sydney students, our group named, ‘Untitled’, and will explain what we went through from brainstorming to developing the idea of Dr.Drone. It contains the struggles, limitations, and happy moments our group has been through while explaining what exactly our final concept ends up as.</p>
                    <p>To briefly overview what we had to do for assessment 1, we had to gather our research both individually and as a group, researching which field we will be focusing on for building a futuristic (next 10 years) autonomous device. First, we came up with many ideas like, educational pen and security drones. But from talking about security, the subject changed to health, and then our group ended up choosing to research the PARAMEDICS and EMERGENCY SERVICES field, as this field have many areas with potentials of improvement and providing better services for both patients and paramedics.</p>

                  <!--insert images-->
                    <P>For Assessment 1, we gained many insights of which area should be improved and developed in the paramedics field. Our group sent out questionnaires, interviews and surveys with people who have experienced the paramedic services (patients or paramedics). The main highlights we have learnt from this was that TIME is important for both patients and paramedics, as they need to go to the patient AS FAST AS POSSIBLE and provide treatment. Today, paramedics are facing difficulties when there is heavy traffic and when cars don’t move out of the way. Also, The MACHINES and EQUIPMENTS used by the paramedics had to be updated for better accuracy as it is not up-to-date with technology as the paramedics need to read it manually instead of a number showing up for easier and faster view. Many patients feel ANXIOUS and ANNOYED when waiting for the ambulance, especially when they are coming very slow. This was because patients don’t know what to do with the injured area as they have no knowledge of how to manage a specific injury. It is also hard for paramedics to use the stretcher in certain situations considering the environment (rocky roads, mountains, countryside, etc) and situations (fire, flood, etc). All of these factors highly triggered our group to help out the tough situation paramedics are positioned in. We wanted to make an autonomous system or device for the paramedics to make sure their working environment gets better, as it is a life saving job.</p>

                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>After our first assessment, our group brainstormed and sketched ideas on how we can improve the streamlining services for paramedics and the patients. Everyone in our group sketched and brainstormed using the research results from assessment 1 and talked about how future ambulance will look like, how people will be transported, how advanced the technology will be and how patients will be treated. We also surfed the internet looking up future autonomous devices. Cars and drones were the main insights from the internet, which we started sketching the future ambulance car/drone. We started off being mainstream and simple then we stretched out further for creativity and for something different. I always love to sketch straight away on my phone when I get an idea, which helped a lot when coming up and thinking of a design. Sadly, my S Pen broke, which I started to carry around a pencil and a small sketchbook from Muji. By trying to make a unique design, I thought of games and cartoons (angry birds, flying cannon, claw machine), but all ended up just being funny. It still helped us to think outside the box. </p>

                  <div class="col-md-12">
                  <p>We continued to sketch and ideate but also watched videos of paramedics in their workfield, their actions and how they were facing difficulties the most. Watching videos helped us to enhance the quality of our work and deepened our knowledge of the paramedics workfield. As we were not experts in this field, we didn’t stress too much about knowing the whole paramedic realm, but we were struggling when trying to apply the autonomous feature in the devices we have sketched. I knew what autonomous was, but I was still confused at some point. I kept thinking to myself, “is this autonomous?” and would always ask my group. (I hope they didn’t get annoyed from it). After all the fun brainstorming and sketching and discussions, our group came up with five awesome creations that could help the paramedic’s streamline services.</p>

The capsule will then drive out of the dangerous situation (fire, earthquake etc). This vehicle is built from combining a stretcher and an oxygen provider.</p>

However, while developing ideas, we thought that driving on road may take too much time for the paramedics to reach the patients - which we came up with height-adjustable wheels.</p>

Zone Medic Drone is basically a drone which will be located in each zone (area) being responsible of any emergency services (first aid) happening in that area. This drone will autonomously pick up the emergency calls and fly to the patient with the medical First Aid Kit. It can also connect the paramedics and patients through voice calls. Paramedics are able to see the situation as well.</p>

                    <p>Disaster Drone is a flying ambulance that can go to areas that are hard to reach by car - without any traffics stopping it approach to patients. It is more like a helicopter drone where the screen (glass) of the drone will be a touch screen - autonomously scanning the patient’s injury and bringing up medical records of them from scanning the face.</p>

                                    <p>After drawing rough sketches of the five ideas, we have chose the top three ideas we liked based on Ashlyn’s feedback and our personal opinions to focus on for our visual report. Our group liked the zone medic drone, the autonomous capsule stretcher and the flying disaster drone, as they have the potentials of actually being able to happen in the next 10 years, and it can also solve the issues the paramedics and patients are currently facing. However, we asked Ashlyn for an advice which helped a lot which we could quickly decide on the main three ideas our group will be working on. They are: </p>

                                    <p>- Zone Medic Drone</p>
                                    <p>- Disaster Drone (Flying Ambulance Drone)</p>
                                    <p>- Autonomous Capsule Stretcher</p>

                                  </div>
                                </div>

                                <div class="row">
                                  <div class="col-md-12">
                                    <p> </p>
                  <p>ZONE MEDIC DRONE</p>
                  <p>Each zone medic drone will have their own designated area, for example, (Redfern A, Redfern B), if an accident happens at Redfern A, the drone that is in charge of that area will quickly pick up the call autonomously and fly to the area with a First Aid Kit. The amount of drones will be distributed based on the population and demand of the area. The drone will also automatically connect itself to the ambulance approaching and provide a live view of the patient’s situation. The paramedics will be able to talk to the patient and tell them instructions of what to do. Once the paramedics arrive, the drone will automatically go back to its dock and charge or refill the First Aid Kit.</p>

                  <p>DISASTER DRONE (FLYING AMBULANCE)</p>
                  <p>The Flying Ambulance Drone can be used in daily situations but will be the most helpful device for accidents happening in natural disaster areas or places that are hard to reach. This idea was more designed for the paramedic’s point of view as they needed more support and help when in dangerous situations like the hard to reach places. Once the paramedics get on the Flying Ambulance drone, the system will get the patient’s location and fly to the destination. If it is hard to find the patient due to surrounding trees or obstacles, the holistic overview scanner will help find the patient and get their health conditions.</p>

                  <p>CAPSULE STRETCHER</p>
                  <p>The capsule stretcher will basically find patients and supply medical resources, then will shield the patient and deliver to the paramedics. This idea came up when we were talking about bushfires and normal fires in buildings and how paramedics will struggle finding the patient where there is smoke everywhere. </p>

                  <p>As soon as we decided on the TOP 3 ideas, it was time to cut down to TWO ideas. Our group really liked all of the ideas, however, we thought that the Autonomous Capsule Stretcher was lacking in practical situations and it wasn’t good enough to push it as a main concept compared to the other two ideas. Therefore, decided to go with the Zone Medic Drone and the Disaster Drone (Flying Ambulance). As we decided on the top two, we were very excited to build upon this idea and create low fidelity paper prototypes.</p>

                    <p>Deciding on the main two ideas to work on sounded amazing and fun as it was the prototyping stage. For fun, I created a paper drone prototype and explained to Ashlyn about the Flying Ambulance Drone (Ashlyn could understand it pretty well from this!). After the feedbacks, our group started to create screens very fast to get a rough idea of what screens we will need. We used the phone screen papers handed out from the tutorial - it helped a lot and we didn’t have to suffer making our own phone rectangles and squares. When working on the screens, we had to consider the user interface, the target user, the device that will be using this interface and how it will be used. As it was meant to be a low fidelity, we didn’t stress much about the visuals, but still had to make sure the users can understand what each icon does, their purpose and how they use it. </p>

                    <p>To see how users will react upon this low fidelity prototype, we conducted the user testing using three methods - Think Aloud Protocol, Co-Discovery, and Post-Semi Structured Interviews.
                      During this stage of creating a low fidelity model, our teammate Josh, also created a High fidelity of an app to get the feel of what we could be working with - it was really cool and it allowed us to get an idea of what the application paramedics/patients will be using could look like.</p>

                    <p>While working on the paper prototypes, we also had to consider WHO we will be testing them on to. As paramedics is such a sensitive and limited field, we ethically felt bad rocking up to an emergency centre - which we decided to shoot an email to all the paramedics we could find. Facebook messaging and getting a reply put our hopes up, but soon after, due to time arrangement, it always got declined. However, we still had to do something about getting the paramedics for user testing. </p>

                    <p>ZONE DRONE PAPER PROTOTYPES</p>

                    <p>The first low fidelity paper prototype we made is the Zone Drone. As it is the very first paper prototype, we were expecting many critical feedbacks. As we tested them to people, we could really understand the problem of our user interface and how the icons and buttons are not consistent. The main feedbacks we have received from the user testing were that it is too complicated, it does not have a simple interface, lack of user control and the design of the interface is too overwhelming with the bunch of information to take into. As the paper prototypes are drawn in our group’s perspective, we could get a lot of feedbacks we didn’t find problems with, or we didn’t think of. I was surprised at each user testing results, as the feedbacks were really good and helpful. Ashlyn’s feedback also gave us cool insights on how we can manage the overwhelming - messy - interface by suggesting a merging system (hard to explain in text..) where each buttons can be tidied up into a dock (like the apples dock). I really liked the idea because I agreed that the screen had too many thing going on at once.</p>

                    <p> The Flying Ambulance Drone got a much more positive feedback, as it wasn’t as complicated and overwhelming as the Zone Drone. People liked how simple the design was, how the added feature of medical records can be sent to the hospital. But there were still comments about the  the location of the buttons, the refresh button not being clear and the purpose of the buttons.</p>

                    <p>After knowing that we won’t be able to find a paramedic for user testing our final high fidelity, our group got really stressed as it wasn’t going the way we expected. We knew looking for a paramedic would be hard but then again, we thought it was possible from many emails and messengers we got for reply. But since the paramedic’s field is about saving lives and chasing the golden time, they could never be certain with the dates of when they will be free. We decided to completely, 360 degrees, entirely pivot the perspective and target the patient’s point of view, instead of the paramedics. We combined the idea of Zone Drone with the Dr.Drone idea (which was eliminated at first round) as by changing the perspective of our target users, we can easily user test our concept to anyone, and also because we can create an app for calling the drone. We knew that it was VERY VERY LATE to pivot completely, but we had no choice and I thought our group can do it because we are amazingaburger! </p>

                    <p>As we already had a brief idea of how Dr.Drone will be looking like, and how it works from previous brainstorming, we decided to concentrate on the application itself. Our group searched up different emergency applications online to get an idea of how other emergency application interfaces look like. We went through all the comment sections of each emergency apps to read the criticising comments of what each apps were lacking in, and considered them on our application, which really helped when we were especially running out of time. We also had many researches done about the patient’s point of view, as I mainly targeted the Korean patients and Josh got the patient’s perspectives as well for the individual user research. Everything was going well, and it was actually really fun working on it because we got to stay at university until late at night, working on the assignment and order Ubereats for dinner! </p>

First of all, we made a high fidelity of Version 1 based off Android layouts - but it wasn’t the ‘high’ fidelity quality Ashlyn wanted, which we all agreed and the suggestion of changing it into iOS layout flipped the quality of our application. Victoria was really good at adapting the iphone layout quickly onto the ‘medium fidelity’ prototype and by this, the aesthetics were also highly improved. By following the iOS layout, the visual hierarchy has also changed which made the user flow easier and clearer. This, we called it Version 2.</p>

We were glad we are getting these feedbacks as soon as possible and are able to go through this procedure many times, for the best high fidelity model. </p>

The instructions were more clear, the nav bars and icons were tidied up and additional screens were added for better flow of the app. Our group worked really hard on this project and I’m really happy for us.
